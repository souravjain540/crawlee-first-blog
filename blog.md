# Launching Crawlee Blog: Your Node.js Resource Hub for Web Scraping and Automation


Hey, Crawling Masters, I am Saurav, Developer Community Manager at Apify and Crawlee. I am thrilled to announce that we are launching the Crawlee Blog today. üéâ

We launched Crawlee in [August 2022](https://blog.apify.com/announcing-crawlee-the-web-scraping-and-browser-automation-library/), the successor to our Apify SDK to make the best web scraping and automation library for Node.js developers writing code in JavaScript or TypeScript.

Since then, our community of developers has grown exponentially. I am proud to tell you that we have over **11500 Stars on GitHub**, over **6000 community members on our Discord**, and over **125000 downloads monthly on npm**. We are the **most popular web scraping and automation library for Node.js developers**. üëè

## Changes in Crawlee since launch

Crawlee has progressively evolved, introducing key features to enhance web scraping and automation.[v3.1](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/compare/v3.0.4...v3.1.0) added an error tracker for analyzing and summarizing failed requests. The [v3.3](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/compare/v3.2.2...v3.3.0) update brought an `exclude` option to the `enqueueLinks` helper and integrated status messages, improving usability on the Apify platform with automatic summary updates in the console UI. 

[v3.4](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/compare/v3.3.3...v3.4.0) introduced the` linkedom` crawler, offering a new parsing option. The [v3.5](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/compare/v3.4.2...v3.5.0) update optimized link enqueuing for efficiency, and [v3.6](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/compare/v3.5.8...v3.6.0) launched experimental support for a new request queue API, enabling parallel execution and improved scalability for multiple scrapers working concurrently, marking significant strides in making web scraping more efficient and robust.

## Future of Crawlee!

The Crawlee team is actively developing an adaptive crawling feature to revolutionize how Crawlee interacts with and navigates through websites. 

We plan to bring experimental support for the new adaptive crawler type in `v3.8` later this week.

## Support us on GitHub.

## Crawlee Blog and the upcoming plans!

We have released many new features to give the Crawlee developer community more power. Now it‚Äôs time to take the next step and expand our community to make **Crawlee the number one web scraping and automation library**.

The first step to achieving this goal is to reach out to the broader developer community through our content.

The Crawlee blog aims to be the best informational hub for Node.js developers interested in web scraping and automation.

**What to expect?**

- How-to-tutorials on making web crawlers, scrapers, and automation applications using Crawlee.
- Thought leadership content on web crawling.
- Crawlee feature updates and changes.
- Community Content Collaboration.

We will post content monthly for our developer community. Stay tuned!

If you have ideas on specific content topics and want to give us input, please [join our Discord community](https://apify.com/discord) and tag me with your ideas. 

Also, we encourage collaboration with the community, so if you have some interesting content pieces related to crawlee, let us know in Discord, and we will feature them on our blog. üòÄ
